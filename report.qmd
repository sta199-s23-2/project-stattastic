## Introduction and data

Our research project will center around the spotifyr, an open source music dataset provided by Spotify. The dataset contains around 5,000 songs from six major music categories (EDM, Latin, Pop, R&B, Rap, and Rock). For each song there contains general information such as the songs album, artist, release data, but also more interesting statistics on danceability, energy, and popularity.

Within the music industry there is always a desire to be able to predict the next big song. Different factors will always play into whether or not a song becomes popular. We wish to explore how danceability, in particular, affects the popularity of songs. To dig a bit deeper, we want to see if the impact of danceability on popularity changes depending on which genre we are exploring.
We are hoping that by exploring this correlation we can create a predictive model for popularity based on danceability. Based on the correlations we find by genre this model may be more accurate for certain genres more so than others.Â
