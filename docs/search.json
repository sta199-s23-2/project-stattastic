For each song there contains general information such as the songs album, artist, release data, but also more interesting statistics on danceability, energy, and popularity."

However, one per data set is required.)\n\nWhich combination of variables would be the best predictor of genre?\nHow does danceability affect popularity of songs of the Latin genre? How about for the Rap genre? Which genre does danceability matter the most when determining popularity?\n\nA description of the research topic along with a concise statement of your hypotheses on this topic.\n\nOur hypothesis is that in the end there will need to be different variables used to calculate likelihood of genre’s but for one general predictor I’d imagine that instrumentalness and danceability would be the best combination to determine.\nFor the second question, I believe that danceability will contribute a larger amount toward popularity for Latin music than Rap music. I also believe that danceability contributes the most to latin music overall.\n\nIdentify the types of variables in your research question. Categorical? Quantitative?\n\nThere is categorical data that explains more general information about the song such as the album name, artist name, genre, but there is also a lot of quantitative data that measures features of the song like danceability, energy, and loudness."

The three main ways Spotify uses data are to develop personalized content, digitize the user’s taste, enhance marketing through targeted ads, continuously update its system, and create Spotify wrapped. Spotify has not claimed a spot in an incredibly competitive industry but has beaten impressive competitors such as Apple and Amazon due to its reliance on data to provide users with music and content they know they will enjoy.\n\nIn 1-2 sentences, explain how your research question builds on / is different than the article you have cited.\n\nSome of our research questions focus on how different factors affect popularity.

For each song there contains general information such as the songs album, artist, release data, but also more interesting statistics on danceability, energy, and popularity.\nWithin the music industry there is always a desire to be able to predict the next big song. Different factors will always play into whether or not a song becomes popular. We wish to explore how danceability, in particular, affects the popularity of songs. To dig a bit deeper, we want to see if the impact of danceability on popularity changes depending on which genre we are exploring.\nWe are hoping that by exploring this correlation we can create a predictive model for popularity based on danceability. Based on the correlations we find by genre this model may be more accurate for certain genres more so than others."
